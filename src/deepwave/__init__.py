"""Wave propagation modules for PyTorch.

Provides forward modelling and backpropagation of the scalar wave
equation (regular and Born), and elastic wave equation.
It can thus be used to generate synthetic data, and to perform
FWI and LSRTM.

Module and functional interfaces are provided, and allow the propagators
to be easily integrated into a larger computational graph, if desired.

For better computational performance, the code is written in C++ and
CUDA.
