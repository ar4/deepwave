class Hicks:
    """Location interpolation onto grid using method of Hicks

    Hicks (2002, https://doi.org/10.1190/1.1451454) proposed
    using a Kaiser windowed sinc function to interpolate
    source and receiver locations onto a grid when they are
    not centred on a grid point. This class implements this
    approach. It can also be used to create dipole sources
    and receivers.

    Args:
        locations:
            A three dimensional Tensor [shot, per_shot, 2] specifying
            the locations to interpolate, provided as float values in
            units of cells relative to the origin of the grid, so
            [[[0.5, 0.5]]] corresponds to the point half a cell from
            the origin in both dimensions.
        halfwidth:
            An integer specifying the halfwidth of the window that
            will be used to interpolate each point onto the grid. A
            halfwidth of 4 (the default) means that an 8x8 window will
            be used. Possible values are in [1, 10].
        free_surfaces:
            A list of four booleans specifying whether the corresponding
            edge of the grid is a free surface, in the order [beginning
            of first dimension, end of first dimension, beginning of
            second dimension, end of second dimension].
            [True, False, False, True] therefore means that the beginning
            of the first dimension and end of the second dimension are
            free surfaces, while the other two edges are not, for example.
            The default is for no edges to be free surfaces.
        model_shape:
            A list of two integers specifying the size of the grid. This
            is only used when the model contains free surfaces.
        monopole:
            A boolean or Tensor of booleans (of shape [shot, per_shot])
            specifying whether the source/receiver is a monopole. If
            False, the point will be a dipole. Default True.
        dipole_dim:
            An integer or Tensor of integers (of shape [shot, per_shot])
            of value 0 or 1 specifying the dimension in which the
            dipole is oriented. This is only used for points that are
            dipoles (not monopoles). Default 0.
        dtype:
            The datatype to use. Default torch.float.
        eps:
            A small value to prevent division by zero. Points closer to
            a grid cell centre than this will be rounded to the grid cell.
            Default 1e-5.
