Scalar Wave Equation
====================

This section details the derivation and implementation of the constant density acoustic scalar wave equation within Deepwave.

Derivation
----------

We derive the constant density acoustic wave equation (a scalar wave equation) by applying Newton's second law (:math:`F=ma`) and the principle of conservation of mass. For a constant density medium, these principles yield, to first order:

.. math::
    :label: newtons_2nd_law

    -\nabla P + \mathbf{f} = \rho_0\ddot{\mathbf{u}}

and

.. math::
    :label: conservation_of_mass

    \dot{\rho} = -\rho_0\nabla\cdot\dot{\mathbf{u}},

where:

*   :math:`P` is pressure.
*   :math:`\mathbf{f}` is an external force per unit area (in 2D) or per unit volume (in 3D).
*   :math:`\mathbf{u}` is particle displacement.
*   :math:`\rho` is the total density.
*   :math:`\rho_0` is the constant background density.

By applying the divergence operator to :eq:`newtons_2nd_law` and the time derivative to :eq:`conservation_of_mass`, we can combine these two equations to obtain:

.. math::
    :label: p_rho_wave_equation

    -\nabla^2 P + \nabla\cdot\mathbf{f} = -\ddot{\rho}.

Assuming pressure and density are proportional, with a constant of proportionality :math:`c^2` (where :math:`c` is the wave speed):

.. math::
    :label: c_definition

    P = c^2\rho

Substituting this relationship into :eq:`p_rho_wave_equation` and rearranging the terms yields the scalar wave equation:

.. math::
    :label: constant_density_acoustic_wave_equation

    \nabla^2 P -\frac{1}{c^2}\ddot{P} = \nabla\cdot\mathbf{f}.

Implementation
--------------

Deepwave implements the scalar wave equation in the form:

.. math::
    :label: scalar_wave_equation

    \nabla^2 u - \frac{1}{c^2}\ddot{u} = f,

where :math:`u` is a scalar field (e.g., pressure) that obeys the wave equation, :math:`c` is the wave speed, and :math:`f` is a scalar source term. Sources are applied at grid cell centers. For instance, if :math:`u` represents pressure (as in :eq:`constant_density_acoustic_wave_equation`), an explosive point source centered on a grid cell corresponds to a single scalar source in :eq:`scalar_wave_equation`.

Deepwave employs central finite differences for both time (second-order accurate) and space (user-specified order of accuracy) to numerically solve this equation within a defined time and space domain.

**Perfectly Matched Layer (PML)**

To prevent unwanted reflections from the spatial boundaries of the computational domain, Deepwave utilizes a `Perfectly Matched Layer (PML) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfectly_matched_layer>`_. For the scalar wave equation, Deepwave adopts the method proposed by `Pasalic and McGarry <https://doi.org/10.1190/1.3513453>`_. In this approach, spatial derivatives are modified within the PML regions:

.. math::
    :label: pml_deriv

    \frac{\partial}{\partial \tilde{x}} = \frac{\partial}{\partial x} + \psi,

where :math:`\psi` is an auxiliary operator defined at time step :math:`t` as:

.. math::
    :label: psi_update

    \psi^t = a\psi^{t-1} + b\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\right)_t,

with :math:`a` and :math:`b` being grid-cell-dependent values. Applying this modification to :eq:`scalar_wave_equation` (simplified to one spatial dimension for illustration):

.. math::
    :label: pml_wave_equation

    \begin{align}
    c^2\frac{\partial^2 u^t}{\partial \tilde{x}^2} - \frac{\partial^2 u^t}{\partial t^2} &= c^2 f^t \\
    c^2\frac{\partial}{\partial \tilde{x}}\left(\frac{\partial u^t}{\partial x} + p^t\right) - \frac{\partial^2 u^t}{\partial t^2} &= c^2 f^t \\
    c^2\left(\frac{\partial^2 u^t}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial p^t}{\partial x} + z^t\right) - \frac{\partial^2 u^t}{\partial t^2} &= c^2 f^t,
    \end{align}

where :math:`p^t` and :math:`z^t` are new auxiliary variables defined as:

.. math::
    :label: p_eqn

    p^t = \psi^t u^t

.. math::
    :label: z_eqn

    z^t = \psi^t \left(\frac{\partial u^t}{\partial x} + p^t\right)

Using finite differences in time with a time step interval :math:`h_t`, the update equation for :math:`u` is:

.. math::
    :label: u_timestep

    u^{t+1} = c^2h_t^2\left(\frac{\partial^2 u^t}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial p^t}{\partial x} + z^t\right) + 2u^t - u^{t-1} - c^2h_t^2 f^t

To ensure computational efficiency, especially on GPUs where independent calculations are preferred, the auxiliary variable update equations are rearranged. Using :eq:`psi_update` in :eq:`p_eqn` and :eq:`z_eqn`, we can calculate :math:`p` and :math:`z` as:

.. math::
    :label: p_update

    p^t = ap^{t-1} + b\frac{\partial u^t}{\partial_x}

.. math::
    :label: z_update

    z^t = az^{t-1} + b\left(\frac{\partial^2 u^t}{\partial_x^2} + \frac{\partial p^t}{\partial x}\right)

The direct dependence of :math:`z^t` on the spatial derivative of :math:`p^t` is problematic for parallel computation. Substituting :eq:`p_update` into :eq:`z_update` yields an expression for :math:`z^t` that is more amenable to parallelization:

.. math::
    :label: z_update_independent

    z^t = az^{t-1} + b\left(\frac{\partial^2 u^t}{\partial_x^2} + \frac{\partial \left(ap^{t-1} + b\frac{\partial u^t}{\partial_x}\right)}{\partial x}\right)

Applying the same transformation to :eq:`u_timestep` results in:

.. math::
    :label: u_timestep_independent

    u^{t+1} = c^2h_t^2\left(\frac{\partial^2 u^t}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial \left(ap^{t-1} + b\frac{\partial u^t}{\partial_x}\right)}{\partial x} + \left(az^{t-1} + b\left(\frac{\partial^2 u^t}{\partial_x^2} + \frac{\partial \left(ap^{t-1} + b\frac{\partial u^t}{\partial_x}\right)}{\partial x}\right)\right)\right) + 2u^t - u^{t-1} - c^2h_t^2 f^t

**Matrix Form of Time Stepping**

Through further rearrangement, each time step can be expressed in a compact matrix form. This representation facilitates the internal computation of the wavefield and auxiliary variables:

.. math::
    :label: scalar_timestep_matrix

    \begin{pmatrix}
    u^{t+1} \\
    u^t \\
    z^t \\
    p^t \\
    r^t
    \end{pmatrix} = 
    \begin{pmatrix}
    c^2h_t^2(1+b)\left((1+b)\partial_x^2 +\partial_x(b)\partial_x\right) + 2 & -1 & c^2h_t^2a & c^2h_t^2(1+b)\left(\partial_x a\right) & -c^2h_t^2 \\
    1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
    b\left((1+b)\partial_{x}^2+\partial_x(b)\partial_x\right) & 0 & a & b\left(\partial_x a\right) & 0\\
    b\partial_x & 0 & 0 & a & 0 \\
    \delta_r & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0
    \end{pmatrix}
    \begin{pmatrix}
    u^t \n    u^{t-1} \n    z^{t-1} \n    p^{t-1} \n    f^t
    \end{pmatrix}

**Output Data**

Time sample :math:`t` of the output receiver data :math:`r` is generated by recording :math:`u^t` at the specified receiver locations :math:`\delta_r`. This ensures that the receiver data covers the same time range and has the same time sampling as the source data. It's important to note that the wavefield :math:`u` is not affected by time sample :math:`t` of the source until time step :math:`t+1` (as shown in :eq:`u_timestep`, where :math:`f^t` is added to :math:`u^{t+1}`). Consequently, the first time sample of the receiver data will not be influenced by the source, and the last time sample of the source will not affect the receiver data.

The propagator returns the final wavefield states: :math:`u^{T}`, :math:`u^{T-1}`, :math:`p_y^{T-1}`, :math:`p_x^{T-1}`, :math:`z_y^{T-1}`, :math:`z_x^{T-1}`, and the recorded receiver data :math:`r`, where :math:`T` is the total number of time steps. These wavefield states can be used to continue propagation in subsequent calls.
